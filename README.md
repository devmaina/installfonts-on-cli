# Font Installation System

This system allows users to install fonts from a central server. Fonts are categorized into "Web Fonts" and "Design Fonts."

## Server-side Setup

1. Upload your font files to a directory on your server.
2. Modify the `install_fonts_server.sh` script to point to the correct font directory.
3. Run the server script:

   ```bash
   ./install_fonts_server.sh
This starts a simple web server to serve font files.

Client-side Setup

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/font-installation-system.git
cd font-installation-system
Modify the install_fonts.sh script:

Set the server_url variable to the URL where your server is hosting fonts.
Run the client script to install fonts:

bash
Copy code
./install_fonts.sh
Follow the on-screen instructions to install web or design fonts.

Upload font files to the font directory.
Note: Ensure that your server is configured for secure file transfer and follows best practices for security.

### Secure File Transfer (SFTP):

To securely transfer font files to the server, you can use SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol). Here are general steps:

1. Connect to your server using an SFTP client.
2. Use your server credentials (username and password or SSH key) for authentication.
3. Navigate to the font directory on the server.
4. Upload font files from your local machine to the server.

Please ensure that your server is properly configured for secure file transfer and follows best practices for security. If you have specific questions about configuring SFTP on your server, consult your server's documentation or seek assistance from your hosting provider.
